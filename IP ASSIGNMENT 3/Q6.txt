Advantages of using OOPS:
1. Object-oriented programming makes the code more organized and reusable.
2. Easy to maintain and modify the code because of the modular structure of objects.

Advantages of using dictionaries:
1. Dictionaries are easy to implement and have a simple syntax.
2. They provide fast access to data as they are hash tables.

Disadvantages of using OOP:
1. Can make the code more complex and harder to understand for someone who is not familiar with the OOP concept.
2. Performance may be slower compared to using dictionaries because of the overhead involved in creating and using objects.

Disadvantages of using dictionaries:
1. Dictionaries do not provide the same level of organization and structure as objects.
2. Dictionaries can be harder to manage if the data structure is complex.
